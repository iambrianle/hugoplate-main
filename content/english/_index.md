    content: "VAM is a non-profit project established by a group of Vietnamese students who moved to the US with their families, studying at high schools and universities. With the desire to ease the burden and anxiety for students and parents while studying and working here, we provide information, share knowledge, and skills through workshops, webinars, and talk shows. To make the integration process into the new life as smooth and effective as possible, VAM will focus on topics such as admission procedures, choosing schools for students from elementary to high school, the university application process, how to connect and build a network, etc. We hope to provide motivation for families to confidently prepare for life in the US."
